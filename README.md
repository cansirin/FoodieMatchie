In this project, we will be building a simple tinder app for restaurant that helps people find their favorite restaurant. Instead of looking at the menu pictures that customers posted on Yelp, we deliver the entire menu for you after you think you like that restaurant. And of course, we provide helpful information that could help you find the restaurant's location. 

# Must have features:

* Get data from API
* Get users' location
* Restaurant Menu
* Displaying correct info for each restaurant
* Picture of the restaurant
* Like and dislike button just like tinder app
* Swipe left and right for like and dislike
* Seeing the distance of the restaurant you like from your location in map

# Nice to have features:

* Sign up an account
* Restaurant address, rating, distance away from you, phone number, and price range
* Limit the distance of restaurants near you from your location as you want

# How to use: 

* Clone the repository to your desktop
* Open project folder
* Open .workspace proj
* Build and Run in XCODE Version 12.2+
