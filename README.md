In this project, we will be building a simple tinder app for restaurant that helps people find their favorite restaurant. Instead of looking at the menu pictures that customers posted on Yelp, we deliver the entire menu for you after you think you like that restaurant. And of course, we provide helpful information that could help you find the restaurant
